# DotneskRemastered

A rewritten version of a private map extractor by me. Now using [Cordycep](https://github.com/Scobalula/Cordycep) for newer Call of Duty titles!

## Output
``*_images_list``: contains list of images needed for texturing, you'll need to use [Greyhound](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound) for extraction

``*_images``: contains a list of semantic of a material needed for shading/texturing

## Libraries used
1. [Cast.NET](https://github.com/Scobalula/Cast.NET)
